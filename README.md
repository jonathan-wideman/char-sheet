char-sheet
==========

Attempt to reproduce the 5th Edition DnD Character Sheet with some digital features.

Uses Bootstrap and AngularJS.

Project Structure
=================

The project is **very** messy at this point. Proceed at your own risk.

The main sheet template is located in index.html and its linked files, which are the following:
  - bootstrap.min.css
  - index.css
  - angular.min.js
  - app.js
They should be migrated out of the project root into a more representative folder structure.
 
The files sheet.html and layout.html and their linked files are mainly tests of styling and layout, repectively.  They should be migrated out of the project root into a testing folder or somesuch.

Building
========

There is nothing to build at this point.

Running
=======

Navigate to index.html in a browser (chrome/chromium is preferred testing environment).
